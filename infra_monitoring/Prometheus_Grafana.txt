| Explore [Monitoring Servers and Docker Containers w/ Prometheus and Grafana] >>>>>>>>>=
=========================================================================================


Background :
----------->
Monitoring is one of the important part of your infrastructure whuch is mandatory to have. None of the Infrastructure is always stable 
and cannot be kept without monitoring and alerting. Here we will be looking into how we can monitor our servers and even docker containers
running inside the server using Grafana, Prometheus, Node Exporter, CAdvisor. 
[1] Grafana: 
	- It's a tool which allow to Visualize, Query, Alert your server metrics.
	- It require to have a Data Source, which can be:
		--> Prometheus
		--> Influx
		--> Aws cloudwatch
		--> etc
[2] Prometheus:
	- It's a monitoring and alerting tool
	- It providess querying and collecting the multidimensional data
	- It's one of the popular data source for Grafana
[3] Node Exporter:
	- Has wide varieties of server metrics.
	- It's captures all the Linux Hardware and Kernel Related metrics.
[4] CAdvisor:
	- It's stand for Container Advisor and used to aggregate and process all the metrics for the running containers.
